# UML-Diagram-Generator

A python script that generates UML class diagrams as PDFs from a repository of C++ code using graphviz's dot language. Usage and documentation
details can be found at the top of `dotGenerator.py`. Example outputs of the diagrams and dot code are in the ExampleOutputs folder -- these describe 
the UWB-Biocomputing/BrainGrid project.
