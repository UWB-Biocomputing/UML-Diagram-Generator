#USAGE: python dotGenerator.py input_file_name.cpp output_file_name
#
#Put this script into the same directory as the file you want to pass it
#and run it by passing in the file you want to start with and a name for the
#output. It will then start with that file and recursively look through
#directories from that location down for files that that file includes.
#
#For example, if you pass in BGDriver.cpp, it will look for all the files that
#BGDriver.cpp includes (including BGDriver.h, if it existed). It will map the
#relationships between those included files and BGDriver as either composition
#or inheritance, and then it will look through all the files that are included
#for their includes recursively. It will then generate several dot diagrams.
#
#It generates three dot diagrams based on the name you passed it: a top-level
#overview file which shows all the connections between all the files not
#included in the ignore list; an overview broken down into subsystems that it
#has attempted to identify, where the connections inside of the subsystems
#have been removed; and a subsystem diagram that shows only connections between
#subsystems at the system level (so no connections between individual files).
#
#It also generates a folder and places all the subsystems that it has identified
#into it. It has no good way of naming those, so it currently just goes through
#the alphabet and numbers, so the outputs will be A.dot, B.dot, etc.
#
#To ignore certain files - simply modify the ignore list near the top of this
#script.
